# What is it?
Simply put, its ensuring *everyone*, regardless of ability, can use your website.

- Not just screen readers
  - Auditory (deafness)
  - Cognitive and learning
  - Physical (temporary too)
  - and yes Visual disabilities (blindness and low vision)

# How?

  - Perceivable (I can perceive it)
  - Operable (I can use it)
  - Understandable (I can understand it)
  - Robust (it works)

# Why?
- It's the “right thing to do”
  - Some studies indicate that half the US population can benefit from web accessibility at some point in their life.
  - Mitigates potential liability, particularly for FinTech or e-commerce space
- It’s not that hard

  - "90 / 10 rule"
  - fallback to good, semantic HTML, not "div soup"

# Keyboard focus

- Blue outline designers always want you to turn off
- Allows users to move through web page with keyboard alone
- Particularly important because many assistive technologies emulates keyboard

*Demo Github Repo*
- Tab
- Shift tab

*Walk through expandy menu*

# Wrap up
That's just one example of how separating behavioral from presentation components and deferring to semantic HTML will save you a lot of pain
